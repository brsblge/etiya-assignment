/// ```dart
/// class FooController extends Controller {
///   FooController(super.logger);
///
///   @override
///   void onStart() {
///     super.onStart();
///     // Do something on start.
///   }
///
///   @override
///   void onClose() {
///     // Do something on close.
///     super.onClose();
///   }
///
///   // Method to be triggered by the corresponding view.
///   void foo() async {
///     context.read<FooCubit>().doSomething();
///     await routeManager.goRoute(context, 'exampleRoute');
///   }
/// }
