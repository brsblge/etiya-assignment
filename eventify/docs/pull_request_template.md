Before submitting this PR, please check the following checklist. 

- [ ] Test on both Android and iOS.
- [ ] Include documentation if needed.
- [ ] Localize all user visible texts.
- [ ] Consider edge cases, not only happy paths.
- [ ] Make sure all the linter warnings are resolved(TODOs are exception).
- [ ] When completing the PR, for feature branches, check that squash merge is selected.

*For all the other merges(e.g. develop -> release, release -> master etc.), basic merge MUST BE USED, not squash.
